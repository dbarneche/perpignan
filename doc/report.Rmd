## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Results

```{r}
drake::readd(out)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
    color_table  <-  c(Asia = 'tomato', Europe = 'chocolate4', Africa = 'dodgerblue2', Americas = 'darkgoldenrod1', Oceania = 'green4')
    col          <-  category_color(data_1982$continent, color_table)
    cex          <-  rescale(sqrt(data_1982$pop), c(0.2, 10))
    continents   <-  unique(data_1982$continent)
    
    plot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data_1982, log = 'x', cex = cex, col = col, pch = 21, las = 1, xlab = 'GDP per capita', ylab = 'Life expectancy (years)', main = '1982')
    for (i in seq_along(continents)) {
        f(data = data_1982, continent = continents[i], color_table = color_table)
    }

plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
